# use .bashrc instead ----------------------------------------------------------

# why I use .bashrc and not .bash_profile: 
# http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html
# .bashrc is executed when you have already logged on to the machine. in other
# words, when you are already sitting at the computer. .bash_profile is executed
# if you logon over ssh or when you are not already logged on.

# if you wanted to try something potentially dangerous out, you could put it
# here. that way, you could just delete this file and not all of .bashrc if
# it didn't work out. :)
