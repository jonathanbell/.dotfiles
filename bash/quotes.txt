Life passes most people by while they're making plans for it.
Lower your expectations; raise your standards.
Travel is the only thing you buy that can make you richer.
Have enough by desiring less.
I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.
Ice is the silent language of the peak; and fire the silent language of the star.
Live below your means.
Do less, with less.
Beware the barrenness of a busy life.
It is easy to get more, but difficult to get less.
Move something!
Be happy.
Your life is not something to survive.
When you can afford your home, you can afford living.
Never settle.
