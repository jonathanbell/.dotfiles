Life passes most people by while they're making plans for it.
Lower your expectations; raise your standards.
Travel is the only thing you buy that can make you richer.
Have enough by desiring less.
I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.
Ice is the silent language of the peak; and fire the silent language of the star.
Do more, with less.
Do less, with less.
Beware the barrenness of a busy life.
It is easy to get more, but difficult to get less.
Move something!
Be happy.
